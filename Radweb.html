<h1>The Radiology Department</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p1>
  Radiology is the medical discipline that uses medical imaging to diagnose and treat diseases within the body tissues of humans.
  A variety of imaging techniques such as <strong>Conventional Xray, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), nuclear medicine including positron emission tomography (PET)</strong>, and <strong>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> are used to diagnose or treat diseases. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are going to look at a few details about the various modalities used within the radiology department.
  <br>

  <ul>
    <h3><li>Conventional Xray</h3>
    
  Primarily utilizes an electrically charged cathode tube to produce ionizing x-ray gamma photons to still-image some soft tissue, organs and skeletal bone structures for diagnosis and prognosis of potential health issues.
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3><li>Ultrasonography</h3>
    Medical ultrasound (also known as diagnostic sonography or ultrasonography) is a diagnostic imaging technique, or therapeutic application of ultrasound. It is used to create an image of internal body structures such as tendons, muscles, joints, blood vessels, and internal organs. Its aim is often to find a source of a disease or exclude a pathology.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><li>Computed Tomography</h3>

  A CT scan, or computed tomography scan, is a medical imaging procedure that uses computer-processed combinations of many X-ray measurements taken from different angles to produce cross-sectional (tomographic) images (virtual "slices") of specific areas of a scanned object, allowing the user to see inside the object without cutting.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3><li>Nuclear Medicine</h3>
  Nuclear medicine is a medical specialty involving the application of radioactive substances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Nuclear medicine imaging, in a sense, is "radiology done inside out" or "endoradiology" because it records radiation emitting from within the body rather than radiation that is generated by external sources like X-rays. In addition, nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology, as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy, but on the function.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3><li>MRI</h3>
  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate images of the organs in the body. MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation, which distinguishes it from CT and PET scans.
